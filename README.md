- ğŸ‘‹ Hi there, Iâ€™m @OdaClay (and not General Kenobi, sorry).
- As you may read just before ğŸ–± clicking ğŸ–± on this README, I'm kind of a little flowa over there. Self-taught in some stuff about web and programing too. 
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in books, rpg and basket ball. Oh, and I'm french, btw. We all have "**_nos dÃ©fauts_**" as we say, here. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning : CSS / HTML. Might considere turning to COBOL for fun (yes, you read it right but well, what can I say ? I love challenges lol).
- ğŸ“« How to reach me ? You here. 
- âš¡ Fun fact about me : dyslexia is my strongest suit :D
